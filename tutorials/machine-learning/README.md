## Machine Learning Tutorials
This section contains tutorials for doing Machine Learning within the Exasol database. We are going to provide examples for different languages and frameworks, tasks and use cases.

**Currently, this repository is under development and we will add more and more frameworks and tutorials in the future.**

### Languages:

* [Python](python)
  * [Scikit-learn](python/scikit-learn):
  
### Prerequisites

For general prerequisites, please refer to [Prerequisites](../README.md). However, these tutorials typically need a specific flavor of the [Script Language Container](https://github.com/exasol/script-languages) which has the required dependencies installed. For these purposes, we provide the python3-ds-* and the fancy-r-* flavors which already contain the dependencies for the frameworks used in these tutorials. Prepackaged releases for this flavor can be found on the [release page](https://github.com/exasol/script-languages/releases).
