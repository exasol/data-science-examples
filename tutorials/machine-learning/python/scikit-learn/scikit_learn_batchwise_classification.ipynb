    "# Distributed and Batch-wise Training and Prediction with scikit-learn in Exasol\n",
    "\n",
    "This example project provides an example for using batch-wise training and prediction with scikit-learn in Exasol. Batch-wise training and prediction allows you to train machine-learning models on data which is larger as the main memory limit of the UDFs. We'll use well known [\"Adult income\"](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult) dataset which consist of data form the 1994 U.S. Census database. The dataset is designed to predict whether an adult person makes over 50K a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the process, we demonstrate that there is no need to export data from Exasol to a different computer or server in order to examine or transform the data. Furthermore, it also isn't necessary for training and testing machine learning models. Everything can be done using user-defined functions (UDFs) directly inside Exasol where the data is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the focus of this example project is on how you can better use machine learning tools with Exasol, we will not discuss machine learning topics such as classifier selection and tuning in depth. Because there are many different machine learning methods, choosing a \"good\" one is highly dependent on the problem to be solved and the data available. Rather, we want to demonstrate how you can more effectively and efficiently use your models with your data in Exasol.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "The intended audience of this article is assumed to have a basic understanding of the following.\n",
    "* Machine learning methods\n",
    "* Exasol, in particular user-defined functions (UDFs)\n",
    "* Python programming, including\n",
    "  * [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)\n",
    "  * [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)\n",
    "  * [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following resources might help to understand these topics:\n",
    "  * Python Machine Learning - Second Edition, Sebastian Raschka, Vahid Mirjalili, September 2017\n",
    "  * Learning scikit-learn: Machine Learning in Python, Raúl Garreta, Guillermo Moncecchi, November 2013\n",
    "  * [EXASOL Manual](https://www.exasol.com/portal/display/DOC/User+Manual+6.1.0)\n",
    "  * [Scikit Learn Ensemble](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html)\n",
    "  * [Scikit Learn Incremental Learning](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/computing/scaling_strategies.html?highlight=incremental%20learning#incremental-learning)\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Technical Notes and Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "* The code in this Jupyter Notebook was tested using Python 3.6 and 3.7.\n",
    "* We recommend that your Exasol instance have at least 6GB RAM.\n",
    "* The code below uses HTTPS to access Exasol's BucketFS by default. If you prefer to use HTTP, please set `EXASOL_BUCKETFS_USE_HTTPS = False` (see [Exasol Setup](#Exasol-Setup)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Readability Tip\n",
    "\n",
    "The UDF scripts below are defined in triple-quoted Python strings (e.g. `sql = textwrap.dedent(f\"\"\"...\"\"\")`), which prevent the Python syntax highlighting from working in the Jupyter Notebook. If you simply remove one of the quotation marks at the beginning of the string (i.e. `sql = textwrap.dedent(f\"\"...\"\"\")`), the syntax highlighting will work which can greatly improve the code's readability. However, please don't forget to add the quotation mark back before executing the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we specify some basic information, which is used throughout this example. In particular, we specify the URL, user name, and password for the Exasol host(s) and EXABucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also specify the scripting language to be used, which is the 'python3-ds-EXASOL-6.0.0' flavor (i.e. Python 3 with selected data science modules for Exasol 6.0), available in Exasol's script-languages GitHub repository. Pre-packaged releases are available in the release area of the Github repository. The 'python3-ds-*' flavors have the added benefit of integrated Pandas DataFrame support for loading data from Exasol into a script (i.e. ctx.get_dataframe()) and emitting data from a script (i.e. ctx.emit()). If you use newer version of the 'python3-ds-*' flavors (since commit 480d79a), you need to change in the EXASOL_UDF_CLIENT from 'exaudfclient' to 'exaudfclient_py3', because since then, Exasol supports Python2 and Python3 UDFs in the same container.\n",
