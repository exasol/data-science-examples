    "\n",
    "Once you set up your Exasol database, you need to allow incoming connections from AzureML Studio. You also need to get the connection info for your cluster, so we can use it later to set up the PyExasol connection to your cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly you need to find the public IP of your AzureML compute instance. If you do not yet have an AzureML compute instance you will need to [set one up](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/quickstart-create-resources).\n",
    "To find the public IP, click the \"Compute\" entry in the menu on the left in AzureML Studio below \"Manage\". Find your compute and open it. Toward the bottom you will find the \"Public IP\".\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img_src/azureML_public_ip.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you need to register the IP with your Saas Database to allow incoming requests form your AzureML compute.\n",
    "In the Saas portal, navigate to your Cluster and click on \"Connect via tools\" on the right. Enter the IP of your AzureML compute instance\n",
    "and \"Add\". Then click \"next\" two times. You will see a screen \"Connection details.\".\n",

    "If you accidentally added a wrong IP you can remove them again under \"Security\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you got your connection information, run [this notebook](../sagemaker/LoadExampleDataIntoExasol.ipynb) to load the [Scania Trucks](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/IDA2016Challenge) dataset into your Exasol Saas Instance (Don't forget to change the connection info in the first cell).\n",
