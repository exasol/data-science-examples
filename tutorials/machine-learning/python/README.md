## Python Tutorials
This section contains tutorials with the Python Programming Language. We are going to provide examples for different frameworks, tasks and use cases.

**Currently, this repository is under development and we will add more and more frameworks and tutorials in the future.**

### Frameworks:

* [Scikit-learn](scikit-learn):
  
  [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy. Its scalability of the training is typically limited. Out-of-core learning is not for all algorithms available, such that the usage of these algorithms is limited by the available main memory. Scikit-learn supports parallel execution through python multi-processing and linear algebra libraries. Distributed training and GPU acceleration is not out of the box available. You can find more details about scalability [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/computing.html).

### Prerequisites

For general prerequisites, please refer to [Prerequisites](../README.md). However, these tutorials typically need a specific flavor of the [Script Language Container](https://github.com/exasol/script-languages) which has the required dependencies installed. For these purposes, we provide the python3-ds-* flavors which already contain the dependencies for the frameworks used in these tutorials. Prepackaged releases for this flavor can be found on the [release page](https://github.com/exasol/script-languages/releases).
