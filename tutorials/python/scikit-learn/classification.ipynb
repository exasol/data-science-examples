    "# Machine Learning Classification Example Using Exasol\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This example project provides an end-to-end demonstration of how machine learning techniques can be used directly inside Exasol to enable and improve data-driven processes and decision making. We'll use real-world data provided by a heavy truck manufacturer (see [Problem and Data Description](#Problem-Description)) to predict if truck failures are related to a specific component or not. The data is publicly available in the [IDA 2016 Challenge dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/IDA2016Challenge) from the Industrial Challenge at the [15th International Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis](http://ida2016.blogs.dsv.su.se/) (IDA) in 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the process, we demonstrate that there is no need to export data from Exasol to a different computer or server in order to examine or transform the data. Furthermore, it also isn't necessary for training and testing machine learning models. Everything can be done using user-defined functions (UDFs) directly inside Exasol where the data is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the focus of this example project is on how you can better use machine learning tools with Exasol, we will not discuss machine learning topics such as classifier selection and tuning in depth. Because there are many different machine learning methods, choosing a \"good\" one is highly dependent on the problem to be solved and the data available. Rather, we want to demonstrate how you can more effectively use <b>your models</b> with <b>your data</b> in Exasol.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example project is broken down into the following sections:\n",

    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "The intended audience of this article is assumed to have a basic understanding of the following.\n",
    "* Machine learning methods\n",
    "* Exasol, in particular user-defined functions (UDFs)\n",
    "* Python programming, including\n",
    "  * [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)\n",
    "  * [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)\n",
    "  * [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following resources might help to understand these topics:\n",
    "  * Python Machine Learning - Second Edition, Sebastian Raschka, Vahid Mirjalili, September 2017\n",
    "  * Learning scikit-learn: Machine Learning in Python, Ra√∫l Garreta, Guillermo Moncecchi, November 2013\n",
    "  * [EXASOL Manual](https://www.exasol.com/portal/display/DOC/User+Manual+6.1.0)\n",
    "### Technical Notes and Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "* The code in this Jupyter Notebook was tested using Python 3.6 and 3.7.\n",
    "* We used Exasol 6.0 for this example. If you prefer to use Exasol 6.1, please remember to select the corresponding script-languages flavor (see [Exasol Setup](#Exasol-Setup)).\n",
    "* We recommend that your Exasol instance have at least 6GB RAM.\n",
    "* The code below uses HTTPS to access Exasol's BucketFS by default. If you prefer to use HTTP, please set `EXASOL_BUCKETFS_USE_HTTPS = False` (see [Exasol Setup](#Exasol-Setup)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Readability Tip\n",
    "\n",
    "The UDF scripts below are defined in triple-quoted Python strings (e.g. `sql = textwrap.dedent(f\"\"\"...\"\"\")`), which prevent the Python syntax highlighting from working in the Jupyter Notebook. If you simply remove one of the quotation marks at the beginning of the string (i.e. `sql = textwrap.dedent(f\"\"...\"\"\")`), the syntax highlighting will work which can greatly improve the code's readability. However, please don't forget to add the quotation mark back before executing the cell."

    "\n",
    "This example is based on the publicly available [IDA 2016 Challenge dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/IDA2016Challenge) from the Industrial Challenge at the [15th International Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis](http://ida2016.blogs.dsv.su.se/) (IDA) in 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the challenge was to best predict which failures were related to a specific component of a truck's air pressure system (APS) as opposed to failures unrelated to the APS. Specifically, the following cost metric was given, which was to be minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "$cost_{total}=cost_{FP}\\cdot{FP} + cost_{FN}\\cdot{FN}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where  \n",
    "$FP$ is the number of false positives (predicted APS failure, but really isn't),  \n",
    "$FN$ is the number of false negatives (predicted non-APS failure, but really is),  \n",
    "$cost_{FP}=10$ is the cost of an unnecessary check by a mechanic, and  \n",
    "$cost_{FN}=500$ is the cost of not checking a faulty truck and possibly causing a breakdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the cost metric, we can see that an unnecessary preventative check is much cheaper (50x) than overlooking a faulty truck, which makes sense.\n",

    "\n",
    "The dataset, provided by [Scania CV AB](https://www.scania.com), consists of real data from heavy Scania trucks during normal operation. The following is a brief description of the data. For details, please see the data description file provided with the data.\n",

    "Here, we specify some basic information, which is used throughout this example. In particular, we specify the URL, user name, and password for the Exasol host(s) and EXABucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also specify the scripting language to be used, which is the 'python3-ds-EXASOL-6.0.0' flavor (i.e. Python 3 with selected data science modules for Exasol 6.0), available in Exasol's [script-languages](https://github.com/exasol/script-languages) GitHub repository. Pre-packaged releases are available in the [release area](https://github.com/exasol/script-languages/releases) of the Github repository. The 'python3-ds-\\*' flavors have the added benefit of integrated [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrame support for loading data from Exasol into a script (i.e. `ctx.get_dataframe()`) and emitting data from a script (i.e. `ctx.emit()`). If you use newer version of the 'python3-ds-\\*' flavors (since commit [480d79a](https://github.com/exasol/script-languages/commit/480d79acaf06df789a7a752b956ffcc7969ca596)), you need to change in the EXASOL_UDF_CLIENT from 'exaudfclient' to 'exaudfclient_py3', because since then, Exasol supports Python2 and Python3 UDFs in the same container."

    "In this small example project, we went through each of the main steps of a machine learning project while using a real-world, industrial problem and data as an example. We started from the very beginning by downloading the data and finished with a production-deployed machine learning model ready to use for making intelligent, data-driven business decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrated that each step in the process can be completed using Exasol's UDFs, so there isn't a need to separate the database from machine learning methods anymore. There's no need to export the data to a separate machine or server in order to analyze it and build and train machine learning models based on it. You can build, train, and test your models by accessing the data directly from inside the database. You can do it all in one place &mdash; Exasol."
